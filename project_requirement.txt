Create a Django app for a Reading list. It should be REST API-driven.
You can create a frontend if you want, but the browsable API should be good enough.
It should allow you to list, add, edit, delete books and mark a book as read.
Each user should only see their own content.

In addition, you can add filters, pagination, or anything else that you feel would make it a good product




1. Authentication
    1. Register User done
    2. Login User

2. Book
    1. Create Book
    2. Retrive Book
    #Update Book Is not required!
    3. List Out All books
3. User Activity
    1. Add book to readling list
    2. Edit
    3. Delete (instead of deleting data deactivate would be better so it will count as delete!)
    4. list out all user reading list
        1. use filter for status
        2. use pagination
